                <h5 class="script">
                  My journey began in the service industry. In my first few years of work, I was a bus boy, server, bartender, and student. I finished high school while maintaining a full-time job at a Logan’s Roadhouse in Jackson, TN. Interactions with guests and management lead me to believe that I wanted to work in the business management sector. After pursuing this until the age of 21, I decided to join the Marines.

                  Joining the Marines was the best experience of my life. Skills I learned were not limited to simply combat oriented abilities. For the first year of my service, I was stationed in an electronics maintenance school. There, I learned about micro component repair work and radio networks. The 4 years of active duty that I served after that were filled with experiences within the circuit repair, UHF/VHF, networking, and system administration fields.

                <h5 class="script">
                  After the Marines, I moved to New Jersey, started school, and had my first child. The responsibility of being a father pushed me in the direction of work over school, and I began to pursue a career with GameStop. At GameStop, I became the store leader for the highest volume store in my district. During my time at the store in the Garden State Plaza, I transitioned into the store leader mentor role. 13 stores from the surrounding area came to me for leadership and direction in the absence of our district leader.

                <h5 class="script">
                  As a gaming enthusiast, I became a part of many gaming communities. From them, I learned basic html and css skills to keep up with our community forums and reddit page. Ultimately, this is what I’ve grown to love doing the most, which lead me to the coding bootcamp at Rutgers. Currently, my dream is to finish this course, and become a front-end developer for a company that allows me to put my leadership and creative skills to good use. I have obtained many incredible leadership qualities and traits over the years that would be valuable to any team that I work with.
